UMN Chess Champs

The project begins! (05/02/2023)
	I have wanted to play around with some networking projects for a while and an idea thats really stuck with me is online multiplayer chess. Most of my experience developing systems is in C and I figure this is probably simple enough not to need a more robust language. Additionally, I'm fairly well practiced with C sockets and error handling so It'd be a safe bet to call this my comfort language.

	I'm a bit fixated on the idea of text user interfaces for software. Maybe its because my hand tremors make mouse use with GUIs more difficult or maybe I was just born in the wrong decade. My vision for thisproject is that CSCI students would download source code onto their school or home linux systems and play with other students to earn some ranking. Obviously this isnt very accessible to any chess player unless they happen to have a computer science background but I'm not really looking to create a million dollar app. Chess already has plenty rendititions on just about every platform created. This project is first and foremost to explore distributed systems and software development concepts.

	I'm looking to learn:
		- Creating sharable software (Packaging, compatibility)
		- Game server functionality
		- Clock synchronization
		- Text user interfaces
		- Web service hosting

I think a good primary step would be to just create offline chess in C. Given the simplicity of chess, I assume that converting this sort of implementation to a networked version would be straight forward.
